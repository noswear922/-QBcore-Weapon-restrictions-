# -QBcore-Weapon-restrictions-
This script is designed for a FiveM server to control the usage of specific weapons within a designated zone. Players can draw their weapons anywhere, but they can only shoot if they are inside the specified zone. If they attempt to shoot outside this zone, they will receive a notification, and their shooting action will be disabled.
